GWT AutoBean splittable interface and teach it how to read JSON from
a ByteBuffer. Parses the structure of the JSON in a single pass, so you can access a few properties and move on.

ByteSplittable:
    Best option for fully populating a json object graph from the stream
  
Shallow:
    Best option for querying an attribute at a time 

Dummy: 
    Demonstrates the java optimization potential of reading a given stream of bytes without processing it.
